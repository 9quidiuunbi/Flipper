Gransazer is considered to be one of the pioneers of the Chouseishin series, a genre of tokusatsu that features giant robots and ancient civilizations. It was produced by Toho Company, the same studio that created Godzilla and other famous kaiju movies. Gransazer was followed by two other Chouseishin series: Genseishin Justirisers and Chousei Kantai Sazer-X.
 
The main theme of Gransazer is the importance of friendship and teamwork. The 12 warriors are divided into four tribes based on their elements: Flame, Wind, Earth and Water. Each tribe has three members who can combine their Chouseishins into a more powerful form.

Together, they face various enemies and challenges that threaten the Earth and its history.
