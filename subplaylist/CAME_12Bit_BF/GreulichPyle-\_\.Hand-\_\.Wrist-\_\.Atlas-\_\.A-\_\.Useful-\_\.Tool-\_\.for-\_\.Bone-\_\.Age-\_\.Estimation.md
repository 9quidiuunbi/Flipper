# Greulich-Pyle Hand & Wrist Atlas: A Useful Tool for Bone Age Estimation
 
The Greulich-Pyle (GP) atlas is a widely used method for estimating the bone age of children and adolescents based on X-ray images of their hand and wrist. The atlas consists of a series of standard images that represent different stages of skeletal development, from birth to 19 years of age. The bone age is determined by comparing the X-ray image of the subject with the closest matching image in the atlas.

However, X-ray imaging involves exposure to ionizing radiation, which may pose health risks, especially for young people. Therefore, researchers have been looking for alternative methods that do not use radiation, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a safe and non-invasive technique that can produce high-quality images of soft tissues and bones.
 
A recent study by Widek et al. [^1^] investigated the feasibility of using the GP atlas on MRI images of the hand and wrist to estimate the bone age of male subjects between 13 and 21 years old. The study used 3 Tesla (3T) MRI scanners, which have a higher magnetic field strength than conventional MRI scanners, and can produce clearer and more detailed images. The study also used 3D gradient echo sequences (VIBE and DESS), which are fast and efficient methods for acquiring MRI data.
 
The study found that the GP atlas can be applied to MRI images of the hand and wrist with good accuracy and reliability. The mean difference between the bone age estimated by MRI and the chronological age of the subjects was only 0.2 years, and the inter-observer agreement was high. The study also found that the VIBE sequence was slightly better than the DESS sequence for bone age estimation, as it had less noise and artifacts.
 
The study concluded that the GP atlas can be used on 3T MRI images of the hand and wrist as a radiation-free alternative to X-ray imaging for bone age estimation. The study suggested that further research is needed to validate this method for female subjects and for different age groups.

VIBE and DESS are two types of MRI sequences that can be used to acquire 3D images of the hand and wrist. MRI sequences are sets of parameters that control how the MRI scanner interacts with the tissues and produces the images. Different sequences have different advantages and disadvantages depending on the purpose of the imaging.
 
VIBE stands for Volumetric Interpolated Breath-hold Examination. It is a modified form of FLASH sequence, which is a fast and efficient sequence that uses a low flip angle and a short repetition time. VIBE uses interpolation and/or partial Fourier techniques to reduce the acquisition time and increase the spatial resolution. VIBE can produce high-quality T1-weighted images in less than 30 seconds, which is ideal for breath-hold imaging of the abdomen and thorax .
 
DESS stands for Dual Echo Steady State. It is a modified form of FISP sequence, which is a fast and efficient sequence that uses a high flip angle and a short repetition time. DESS uses two echoes per excitation to produce two images with different contrast: one with T2-weighted contrast and one with intermediate contrast. DESS can produce high-resolution images of cartilage and bone .
 
Both VIBE and DESS sequences can be used to visualize the hand and wrist bones on MRI, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. VIBE has better signal-to-noise ratio and less susceptibility artifacts than DESS, but it also has more motion artifacts and lower contrast between bone and soft tissue. DESS has better contrast between bone and soft tissue than VIBE, but it also has more susceptibility artifacts and lower signal-to-noise ratio [^1^].
